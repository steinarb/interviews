	How to Build InterViews in Five Easy Steps

1. Install bootstrap programs			make bootstrap
2. Generate the global Makefile			make Makefile
3. Generate local Makefiles			make Makefiles
4. Generate dependencies in local Makefiles	make depend
5. Generate all the binaries			make -k

Alternatively, saying 'make World' does steps 2,3,4 and 5.

Step 1 creates a directory named iv/installed/bin/<CPU>, where <CPU>
represents your computer's cpu type, and installs imake, makedepend,
and some other programs in it.  To make the rest of the steps work,
you must type

   setenv CPU <CPU>
   setenv PATH /iv/installed/bin/<CPU>:$PATH

before you say 'make Makefile' or 'make World' in step 2.

For more detailed instructions, read the release notes and differences
from previous releases in iv/src/man/cover.  These files also tell you
who to contact if you have any questions or problems.
