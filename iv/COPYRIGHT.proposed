	     **Notice** 6/12/2000(modified 8/22/2000) **

This proposed revised license is no longer under active
consideration. It seems what I proposed below would make the nature of
the licensing fixed, and I'm not that sure about it to cast it in
stone.  I am really looking for a free software acceptable LGPL-like
extension to the BSD/X11 license that approximates the WxWindows
license (which grants more freedom with binaries than the basic LGPL).
Send any thoughts to ivtools-info@vectaport.com.

** As of September 2000 I've started dual licensing with GPL if
** anybody wants that. I will gladly help maintain a GPL version of
** the source and a GPL patch history for those whose choose
** not to dual license their contribution.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm considering a possible modification to the ivtools COPYRIGHT
notice, to take affect with ivtools-0.8.  The idea is to get some of
the protection of an LGPL style license without adapting a license
that Stallman himself is unenthusiastic about.  I'm aiming for an
effect similar to that of the WxWindows license, which is LGPL with an
exception that allows binary redistributors to use any terms they
like.  Here's the URL that explains more on their license:

http://web.ukonline.co.uk/julian.smart/wxwin/newlicen.htm

The proposed new COPYRIGHT is attached.  This is what is different
from the old one:

	- the first sentence of the permission notice no longer grants
          permission to modify the software, documentation, or data, *however*

	- the second sentence of the permission notice grants the
          right to modify provided all the restrictions in the first
	  sentence are met, and any distribution is either:

		a) entirely in a final rendered form without sources
		for software or documentation (source for data is ok).

				*or*

		b) the original permission notice remains intact and
		in force.

The intent is to keep third-parties from adapting any other form of
source-code license.  It will still allow third-parties to distribute
modified derivative works in binary forms, something always allowed by
the X11 style license.  Also I think clause a) allows for the
redistribution of modified shell scripts and include files, since they
can be considered to be in a final rendered form.

This is designed to prevent any involuntary forking of the source
tree, in that no company or non-profit could adapt an incompatible
source license and start publishing modified source code whose diffs
can't be integrated back into the original.  

This is not meant to apply to separate works that are built on top of
ivtools which would probably include derived classes that are
bootstrapped by copying ivtools classes.  Except in how it impacts
their redistribution of the ivtools layer.  Maybe that needs to be
clarified.  A possible third sentence would read:

	The activity of initiating a separate and partial derivative
	work by duplicating then modifying the sources is permitted as
	well, provided the terms for usage, copying, distribution, and
	selling are met.

Comments?  Does anybody have an idea if this will pass the Debian Free
Software Guidelines?  I know it meets the spirit of the Debian
project, and formalizes how the collaboration between Guenter Geiger
and myself has progressed.
