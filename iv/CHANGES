November 16th, 2003  ivtools-1.1.1

- add missing src/include/ivstd/strstream.h to MANIFEST file and tar file


October 29th, 2003  ivtools-1.1.0

- re-enable use of shared memory for X11 image rendering under MacOS X

- fix command passed to popen() to detect executables on MacOS X

- fix up some AttrValue stuff

- all the changes it took to get it built with ACE on MacOS X (though
it doesn't work yet).

- the cpp bundled with gcc-3.3 has a bug, and gets confused by
back-slashed commas in macro arguments (it thinks they start a new
argument, which they don't).  This introduced a problem to long stable
config files, but a workaround is here.

- this also fixes things so FreeBSD can configure on alpha architectures.

- add -svgexport flag to drawtool that by default suppresses (the
incomplete) SVG export mechanism.

- incorporate an XML dump of all the SourceForge tracker info, in case
SourceForge goes away (sourceforge.102203.xml).
