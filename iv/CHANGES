Apr 5th 2001 ivtools-0.9.2

- set of changes to allow save/restore of graphics files internal to a
drawing by the Unix command line used to generate them.  For example,
if "xwdtopnm temp.xwd" was used to import a raster file (with "from
command" checked on the import dialog box), a subsequent save would
write this command (and only this command) to the document on disk,
and a subsequent restore would re-run the command to regenerate the
contents.  Should work equally well for rasters, PostScript, and
ivtools drawtool files.

- remove anytopnm from ivtools, since the enhancements our copy had
over pbmplus were incorporated directly into the netpbm variant.  The
salient feature was the ability for anytopnm to recognize it had a
file that was already in a pbmplus format, and pass it through.

- remove duplicate IVGlyph/figure.[ch] from MANIFEST

- add /usr/local/include/g++-3 and /usr/local/include/g++-2 to paths
searched for libstdc++ include files by configure.

- add "wget" to the list of download utilities searched for and used
by the code that reads URLs.  The others are ivdl (from ivtools),
curl, and w3c.

- changes to support compiling with older versions of libg++ and
changes to support relative installation (--enable-install-relative)
on FreeBSD.  

- add "name" and "value" labels to the attribute-list editing dialog box.

- save rasters imported from Unix commands by writing out only the
command string in an generic by-file drawtool object.  For example:

	ovfile(:popen "djpeg -pnm test.jpg" ) 

would be output  to the saved document if  save-by-path was checked on
the import box and save-by-path is checked (for the whole document) on
the export box.  Subsequent opens rerun the command.


Jan 10th 2001 ivtools-0.9.1

Correct 0.9 oversights:

- restore GPL dual licensing documentation in COPYRIGHT, COPYING, and
MANIFEST.

- correctly set version number to 0.9.1

December 19th 2000 ivtools-0.9

- fix segfault in new comdraw addtool command when the supplied
pathname is non-existent.

- allow for using new symbols (those with a nil value) in the various
assignment operators of comterp, i.e. x++ or x+=1 work if x was
undefined.

- make ivtools available under the GPL as well as the original X11
style license.

- changes type of third argument to accept() from an unportable
(unsigned int*) to a more correct (socklent_t *) (in
src/utils/sockets.cc).  First done by Guenter Geiger in his
Debianization of ivtools-0.8.3

- partial build (up to glyphterp and comterp) on SunOS 4.1.4 with
gcc-2.4.5.  After that I ran into static initialization (even though
using collect2) and multiple-inheritance problems that made it no
longer worth it.

- patches for building with libace5.0 under Debian 2.3 (woody).

- fix up the construction of symbolic links for Unidraw-common done by
the configure script.

- revises and extends the comterp pause, trace, and step commands.
