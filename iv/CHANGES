Jan 10th 2000 ivtools-0.9.1

Correct 0.9 oversights:

- restore GPL dual licensing documentation in COPYRIGHT, COPYING, and
MANIFEST.

- correctly set version number to 0.9.1

December 19th 2000 ivtools-0.9

- fix segfault in new comdraw addtool command when the supplied
pathname is non-existent.

- allow for using new symbols (those with a nil value) in the various
assignment operators of comterp, i.e. x++ or x+=1 work if x was
undefined.

- make ivtools available under the GPL as well as the original X11
style license.

- changes type of third argument to accept() from an unportable
(unsigned int*) to a more correct (socklent_t *) (in
src/utils/sockets.cc).  First done by Guenter Geiger in his
Debianization of ivtools-0.8.3

- partial build (up to glyphterp and comterp) on SunOS 4.1.4 with
gcc-2.4.5.  After that I ran into static initialization (even though
using collect2) and multiple-inheritance problems that made it no
longer worth it.

- patches for building with libace5.0 under Debian 2.3 (woody).

- fix up the construction of symbolic links for Unidraw-common done by
the configure script.

- revises and extends the comterp pause, trace, and step commands.
