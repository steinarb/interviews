- add comdraw funcs to poke (grey-level) pixel values into a raster,
and return the horizontal and vertical extent of the raster:

	 poke(compview x y val) -- poke pixel value into raster
	 pcols(compview) -- number of columns in a raster
	 pcols(compview) -- number of rows in a raster

- sometimes you can accidentally create a polygon with zero points (or
a multi-line or spline).  Changes to safeguard against crashing
whenever this happens.

- fix bug in comterp stream traversal via NextFunc::execute_impl.  It
was leaving an extra null-value on the stack, which confused the
interpreter.

- add an undocumented debug comterp func, stackheight

- tweak of imake system to facilitate NetBSD packaging

- add "None" color to background color menu, exposing the hidden
fillbg flag (transparent background mechanism) for the first time in
the history of this software.

- fix drawing editor import's use of gunzip to decompress graphic
files.

- update config.guess and config.sub, support scripts for the
configure script from the autoconf package.  May fix some known
problems with HPUX, ALPHA, and ARM.

- add a comdraw command to create white rasters initialized with a 2
pixel wide black border:

	compview=raster(x0,y0,x1,y1) -- create an empty raster

- make equality and inequality operators work for list objects.  Note
that the "," list concatenation operator always appends the second
operand to the first operand if it is already a list, as illustrated
by this example ("> " inserted for clarity):

> l1=1,2,3
{1,2,3}
> l2=l1,4
{1,2,3,4}
> l1==l2
1

Alternately the "list" command can be used to create a distinct list:

> l1=1,2,3
{1,2,3}
> l2=list(l1),4
{1,2,3,4}
> l1==l2
0

- fix up some more handling of nil by arithmetic operators.  The rule
is nil in, nil out.

- minor fixup in comterp error message system

- pclip command for clipping of rasters via a polygonal point list:

 pclip(compview x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3[,...,xn,yn]) -- clip raster with polygon

- dtog and gtod commands for translating to/from graphic coordinates
to drawing coordinates:

 gx,gy=dtog(compview dx,dy) -- convert from drawing to graphic coordinates
 dx,dy=gtod(compview gx,gy) -- convert from graphic to drawing coordinates

- migration of conditional #define's from Time.c to Time.h by Todd Gruhn.

- work on stdin handling for comdraw, flipbook, graphdraw, and drawserv



November 2nd, 2001  ivtools-1.0

See CHANGES-0.9 for recent major changes.

Minor changes since Oct. 16th 2001 (ivtools-0.9.7):

- revise MANIFEST.comterp to reflect current state of comterp.

- fix comterp memcpy problem on 64 bit Alpha

- fix gcc-3.0.* build without ACE

- fix compilation of Time/Time.c on NETBSD.

- add :posteval flag to comterp help command in order to see which
commands are control constructs (post-evaluated, i.e. there arguments
are passed to them in an unevaluated state.  The result is:

  cond,for,help,if,list,next,posteval,postfix,stream,while

There are some post-evaluated operators as well.

- restore symid and symadd to be normal, non post-evaluated commands.
Didn't seem to be necessary, and making this change makes them
available for streaming.

- make confirmbox command return nil if Cancel is pressed.

- comterp operator streaming fixes, mostly along the lines of working
out nil termination in different circumstances.

- $ unary-prefix operator as a short-cut for stream command.  Useful
when copying the same stream many times in one command.

- each operator traverses a stream, exercising it until the end, and
returns the length count.

- make the AttributeValueList constructor that takes an
AttributeValueList* a truly deep copy.

- doc changes
