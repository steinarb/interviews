June 3rd, 2004  ivtools-1.2

ivtools-1.2 sets a new direction for the package, toward peer-to-peer
drawing chat.  ivtools' drawserv, the editor that incorporates every ivtool
mechanism to date (multi-frame, graph-editing, integrated scripting
language) has been extended to support a unique kind of
small-granularity shared whiteboard.  

This work was based on the pre-existing networked scripting capability
of ivtools' comdraw.  Then the pasting of any graphic was intercepted,
and the graphic serialized into a command that could be communicated
to other drawing editors to keep them in sync.

Then a connection management system was established, that supported
two-way peer-to-peer links between drawing editors.  In addition the
return path on each socket was used for detecting timeout, which
causes the connection to be dropped.

Finally, a distributed mutually-exclusive graphic selection mechanism
was created, where every drawing editor is aware of who currently has
a graphic selected or who had it selected last if it is not currently
selected.  When one drawing editor tries to select a graphic, it first
requests that permission from the last selector (after determining it
is unselected).

Now you can link to other drawing editors, draw graphics and see them
appear remotely (although only in black and white), and exercise the
distributed selection mechanism.  Four pieces remain to be developed:
1) support for full-up graphic state transmittal (it is sent, but not
interpreted on the remote end);, 2) support for transmission of the
complete set of drawing editor commands; 3) extending the distributed
mutual-exclusion mechanism to select pseudo-graphics to acquire global
permission for connection, pasting, moving front-to-back, and
grouping; and 4) a two-tier mechanism for invoking select(), that will
allow the bypass of selection requests while engaged in lengthy direct
manipulations.

If all this interests you, and you'd like to help, build this version
of ivtools with ACE support, subscribe to the ivtools-dev mailing, and
help me do some testing, programming, thinking, whatever.  Or visit
