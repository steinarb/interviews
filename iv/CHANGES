November 2nd, 2001  ivtools-1.0

See CHANGES-0.9 for recent major changes.

Minor changes since Oct. 16th 2001 (ivtools-0.9.7):

- revise MANIFEST.comterp to reflect current state of comterp.

- fix comterp memcpy problem on 64 bit Alpha

- fix gcc-3.0.* build without ACE

- fix compilation of Time/Time.c on NETBSD.

- add :posteval flag to comterp help command in order to see which
commands are control constructs (post-evaluated, i.e. there arguments
are passed to them in an unevaluated state.  The result is:

  cond,for,help,if,list,next,posteval,postfix,stream,while

There are some post-evaluated operators as well.

- restore symid and symadd to be normal, non post-evaluated commands.
Didn't seem to be necessary, and making this change makes them
available for streaming.

- make confirmbox command return nil if Cancel is pressed.

- comterp operator streaming fixes, mostly along the lines of working
out nil termination in different circumstances.

- $ unary-prefix operator as a short-cut for stream command.  Useful
when copying the same stream many times in one command.

- each operator traverses a stream, exercising it until the end, and
returns the length count.

- make the AttributeValueList constructor that takes an
AttributeValueList* a truly deep copy.

- doc changes
