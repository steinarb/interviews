Aug 20th 2001 ivtools-0.9.6

- minor adjustments to adapt to gcc-3.0.1.  One advantage of upgrading
to gcc-3.0.1 is that incremental import of rasters from URL's works
again.

- introduce all the bitwise operators from C to comterp: &, |, ^, and
~.  This change is slightly backward incompatible, in that "^" had
been used as a shortcut for the pow command (raise something to a
power).  Scripts that rely on that single operator will need to be
rewritten.  Sorry for doing that -- but it is the first incompatible
change in I can't remember how long, and something I wanted to get
done before version 1.0 (where the syntax and semantics of comterp get
"frozen", ready for wider use).

- renames the tiftopnm bash script to a less confusing ivtiftopnm
(less confusing in that people won't think it is part of netpbm).
ivtiftopnm is a wrapper script for tifftopnm, which doesn't accept
stdin input directly (because of its need for random access to the
tiff file).


Jul 25th 2001 ivtools-0.9.5

** Most of the outstanding problems with gcc-3.0 and libstdc++-v3 have
** been resolved.  Only known problem is with incremental importing
** (and display) of rasters from URL's.  This is a long-standing
** stable feature of ivtools.  Perhaps newer versions of gcc-3.* and
** libstdc++-v3 will fix the problem.

- fixes a problem with importing files introduced when migrating away
from the use of istream::gets (required for gcc-3.0 and libstdc++ v3).
istream::gets would automatically skip the newline delimeter.  When
using istream::get in libstdc++ v3 I needed to manually skip the
newline delimeter.

- globally change optimization from -O6 to -O2, which makes gcc-3.0
compile time much more reasonable.

- all the necessary changes to support ACE and gcc-3.0 at the same
time.  The majority of the work is in deferring (or avoiding) an
fclose on a fdopen'ed socket, by a) saving a FILE* in some class to be
fclose'd later, or b) rewriting without iostreams.  Now there should
no longer be any dangling FILE*'s to worry about.

- adds built-in support for PNG rasters.  That means they can be
imported and save/restored by pathname (like JPEG and GIF).  This
requires that pngtopnm be available to be invoked by the ivtools
drawing editors.

- added test for whether socklen_t is typedef'ed to the configure
script.  Seems older versions of FreeBSD doen't have this.

- fix the test for whether the X11 Shared Memory extensions exists in
the server, and whether it can be utilized (which requires co-resident
client and server).

- add a -c argument (copy instead of move) to every install command
for the benefit of the BSD's.

- use "r+" for fopen of files to be rewound, otherwise they never get
rewound.  This is a recently introduced problem.  "r+" is supposed to
mean opening for reading and writing, but it seems necessary for
rewinding as well.


Jun 15th 2001 ivtools-0.9.4

- monstrous amount of changes required by forthcoming gcc-3.0.  The
heavy lifting was mostly due to the absence of filebuf::attach in v3
of libstdc++.  

Other issues to deal with: templated iostreams, change to meaning of
-U (undefine compiler option), can't have static const char
initializes in class definition, need class between "friend" and class
name, use of <iosfwd>, missing ostream::form, missing istream::gets,
round needs to be Math::round.

Unfortunately, gdb can't debug C++ generated by gcc-3.0 yet, so
although things mostly work, I can't resolve problems with the wild
iostream hacking I did.  My recommendation: stick to gcc-2.95.* for
now.

- add an :eps and :idraw option to the comdraw export keyboard command.
Now you can generate these formats as well as the default drawtool
format.

- fix export of EPS with color imagery, by correctly reading radio
button for output format on export dialog box.  Before it only
generated the idraw format, which is EPS, but has only graylevel
rasters visible to any PostScript interpreter (the color information
is in comments).

- change the declaration of an argument to getsockname() from unsigned
int to socklen_t (in Dispatch/rpcbuf.c).  This fixes the problem with
portability caused by the fact signedness of a socklen_t is
unstandardized.

- restore full support for XBM (X bitmap) images to drawtool and its
derivatives.  idraw was always XBM capable, but drawtool lost support
for this a while back.

May 18th 2001 ivtools-0.9.3

Keyboard Commands:

- add save func to comdraw:

	error=save([path]) -- save editor document (to pathname) 

With no argument it saves using the current document name.  If none is
current the SaveAs dialog box pops up.  If the file already exists a
warning dialog box pops up.  If the current document is unmodified the
func returns zero without doing anything.

With a pathname argument it always tries to save to the document to
that file, returning zero if the save doesn't work (at least it will
after a bug is fixed).  If the file already exists a warning dialog
box pops up.

- add export func to comdraw:

with ACE:
   export(compview[,compview[,...compview]] [path] :host host_str :port port_int :socket :string|:str) -- export in drawtool format

without ACE:
   export(compview[,compview[,...compview]] [path] :string|:str) -- export in drawtool format ";

- add comdraw funcs to convert between drawing and screen coordinates:

	dx,dy=stod(sx,sy) -- convert from screen to drawing coordinates
	sx,sy=dtos(dx,dy) -- convert from drawing to screen coordinates

- convert output of help func to a string, so it can be displayed in
the keyboard command window on comdraw/graphdraw/flipbook/drawserv.

Miscellaneous:

- applied diffs by Guenter Geiger to generate ivtools-0.9.2-1 for
latest Debian (sid).

- attempt to upgrade to ACE 5.1

- put an arbitrary glyph in the lower left of each drawing editor with
a keyboard command window. Defaults to text describing the editor and
how to get help on keyboard commands.

- check that an AttributeValue is_object() or is_command() before
returning the void* pointer associated with some C++ object.

- change for building on Solaris 2.6.

- bug fix in growgroup comdraw func.




Apr 5th 2001 ivtools-0.9.2

- set of changes to allow save/restore of graphics files internal to a
drawing by the Unix command line used to generate them.  For example,
if "xwdtopnm temp.xwd" was used to import a raster file (with "from
command" checked on the import dialog box), a subsequent save would
write this command (and only this command) to the document on disk,
and a subsequent restore would re-run the command to regenerate the
contents.  Should work equally well for rasters, PostScript, and
ivtools drawtool files.

- remove anytopnm from ivtools, since the enhancements our copy had
over pbmplus were incorporated directly into the netpbm variant.  The
salient feature was the ability for anytopnm to recognize it had a
file that was already in a pbmplus format, and pass it through.

- remove duplicate IVGlyph/figure.[ch] from MANIFEST

- add /usr/local/include/g++-3 and /usr/local/include/g++-2 to paths
searched for libstdc++ include files by configure.

- add "wget" to the list of download utilities searched for and used
by the code that reads URLs.  The others are ivdl (from ivtools),
curl, and w3c.

- changes to support compiling with older versions of libg++ and
changes to support relative installation (--enable-install-relative)
on FreeBSD.  

- add "name" and "value" labels to the attribute-list editing dialog box.

- save rasters imported from Unix commands by writing out only the
command string in an generic by-file drawtool object.  For example:

	ovfile(:popen "djpeg -pnm test.jpg" ) 

would be output  to the saved document if  save-by-path was checked on
the import box and save-by-path is checked (for the whole document) on
the export box.  Subsequent opens rerun the command.


Jan 10th 2001 ivtools-0.9.1

Correct 0.9 oversights:

- restore GPL dual licensing documentation in COPYRIGHT, COPYING, and
MANIFEST.

- correctly set version number to 0.9.1

December 19th 2000 ivtools-0.9

- fix segfault in new comdraw addtool command when the supplied
pathname is non-existent.

- allow for using new symbols (those with a nil value) in the various
assignment operators of comterp, i.e. x++ or x+=1 work if x was
undefined.

- make ivtools available under the GPL as well as the original X11
style license.

- changes type of third argument to accept() from an unportable
(unsigned int*) to a more correct (socklent_t *) (in
src/utils/sockets.cc).  First done by Guenter Geiger in his
Debianization of ivtools-0.8.3

- partial build (up to glyphterp and comterp) on SunOS 4.1.4 with
gcc-2.4.5.  After that I ran into static initialization (even though
using collect2) and multiple-inheritance problems that made it no
longer worth it.

- patches for building with libace5.0 under Debian 2.3 (woody).

- fix up the construction of symbolic links for Unidraw-common done by
the configure script.

- revises and extends the comterp pause, trace, and step commands.
