January 18th 2000 ivtools-0.8

Drawing Editor Changes

	* add "center" and "mbr" commands to comdraw, to return the
	center and minimum-bounding rectangle of a graphic.

	* make select-all the default behavior of the comdraw "select"
	command.

	* add -stripped argument to comdraw, to remove menubar and
	toolbar.  Use a -geometry as well to specify size of canvas.
	Control resultant program via stdin or telnet using the
	builtin command interpreter.  

	* add Pull/Push By One Commands to the Structure menu in
	drawtool, also making them available to any OverlayUnidraw
	based program.

Interpreter Changes
 
	* add LISP-like symbol assignment semantics to comterp.  Now
	expressions that return a symbol can appear on the right hand
	or left hand side of an assigment operator.  See new command
	"symvar", and "symbol" has been renamed "symval".

	* add support for command aliases to comterp, to allow
	multiple symbols to point to a command without having them
	listed via help.

	* make posteval((1)) work, by improved handling of the token
	generated for the extra nested parens.  Problem still remain
	with the handling of some forms of nested parens in
	post-evaluated expressions, but this is a start at fixing
	them.  This is the last outstanding known bug in the comterp
	language, though many features remain to be added.

	* fix problem with nested parens in post-evaluated
	expressions.  Now commands like these work:

	posteval((1+2)*3)

	cond((1+2)*3 1 0)

	The problem originated when for some reason the underlying
	parser was modified to spew a Blank whenever it popped an
	empty paren pair from the parser stack.  Doing that made
	something, I don't recall what, and could be useful in the
	future for representing n-depth streams by nested parens
	(i.e. ((1,2,3),(3,4,5),(5,6,7)) could be a 3x3 pixmap (or a
	list of 3 rgb values).

Config and Misc. Changes

	* add NetBSD support.

	* finalize links from embedded html (extractable by PERCEPS)
	to pre-existing man pages.  Now every man page can be reached
	by its corresponding classes html documentation.

	* test and revise the src/html/README that describes how to
	gen a set of ivtools html documentation.
