 * It's real useful to know the version of hc we're using, but hc doesn't
 * identify itself in the pre-processor, so we have to do it by hand.
 *
 * To determine which version of hc you have, compile (DON'T link) some simple 
 * program ("hello world" leaps to mind) and look in the .o (with "nm") for a 
 * symbol named ".oVhc[0-9].[0-9][a-z]" -- this symbol is included in all 
 * .o's by hc, and identifies the compiler release.
 * 
 * To Calculate HCRevision, multiply the version number by 1000 and add the
 * index of the release letter.
 * For example, if nm reports:
 *	00000000 A .oVhc2.1d
 * The HCRevision is ((2.1 * 1000)+('d'-'a'+1)) == 21004
 * Another popular version of hc is:
 *	00000000 A .oVhc1.4r
 * Whose HCRevision is ((1.4 * 1000)+('r'-'a'+1)) == 14018
 *
 * A good clue that HCRevision is defined incorrectly is the undefined symbol
 * '_Alloca' at load time.
