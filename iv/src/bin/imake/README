To add support for a new platform, you need to do two things:

    1.  If your C compiler doesn't provide any unique symbols, you'll need
	to make one up and add it to the cpp_argv table in imake.c.  It should
	be ifdef'ed on the value of the symbol itself.  This will be set by
	the BOOTSTRAPCFLAGS make variable.

    2.  If you need any special compiler switches or definitions (besides
	the BOOTSTRAPCFLAGS value choosen above) to get imake.c to compile,
	add them to ccflags.c ifdef'ed on the same symbol as before.


Makefile.ini is initially used to build imake.  After that, it simply uses its
own imakefile.
