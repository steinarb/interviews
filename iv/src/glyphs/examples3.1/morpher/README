                        ****IMorpher****

IMorpher is a glyph based application that tries to morph between
idraw drawings.  Currently, the implementation doesn't work with
textual objects.  The user interface is very similar to gob except it
has more control buttons (like those on a VCR) at the bottom.  You can
import an idraw drawing using the "Import" pulldown menu, then you can
use the record button (fourth button from the left) to record it.
After recording several frames, you can see the animation by pressing
the forward play button (third from the right).  Other buttons are
self-explanatory.  You can move, scale or rotate these objects while
they are animating (or morphing).  Control-left-mouse on the viewing
area will rate-scroll the animation, control-middle-mouse is
grab-scroll and control-right-mouse is rate-zoom.
