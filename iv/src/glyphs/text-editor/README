Simple InterViews Text Editor
-----------------------------

This is my first version of an InterViews 3.1 texteditor class. I have tried
to implement a simple text editor that can be used in IV 3.1 applications.
The goal was _not_ to implement a full-featured editor (we have emacs, don't
we (-; ). 

It uses the 2.6 TextEditor/TextBuffer classes and was inspired by some code
posted by Frank Zenner (zenner@dfki.uni-sb.de) a few month ago. Even if I 
have not used any of his code directly it was very useful as an introduction
of how 2.6 classes can be used.

Some features are:

 - loads/saves buffer from/to files
 - dynamically allocates memory when buffer expands
 - supports selectons (both primary and clipboard) from the editor
 - have emacs-style (and Sun keyboard) key mappings
 - popup-menu to load/save files
 - Somewhat similar to Sun's Text Editor (left mouse button selects, 
   middle mouse button expand selection, right mouse button gives a
   popup-menu)
 - double-click selects word, tripple-click selects line

I do not consider my work as completed, but I believe the editor is usable.
I have never used 2.6 classes before and I'm sure it could have been 
structured in a better way. Comments are welcome!

Things plan to do (if I could find the time):

 - add text search popup
 - add at least one level of undo
 - enable definition of menus and key mappings from resources
 - add popup to enable specification of find patterns
 - I bet there are bugs, but not currently known by me...
 - add many more edit functions to the EivTextEditor class

(the list could be much longer, but this is what I plan to implement)

Have Fun!
