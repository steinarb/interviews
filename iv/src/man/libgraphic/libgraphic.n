libgraphic \- InterViews structured graphics library
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIlibgraphic\fP library provides a set of classes for defining
persistent structured graphics.  \fBGraphic\fP is the base class for
structured graphics objects; prederived classes classes include simple
graphical objects (\fBPoint, Ellipse, Spline, Label,\fP etc.), a composite
object (\fBPicture\fP), and an object that is a variation on another object
(\fBInstance\fP).  Each graphic can be manipulated and transformed
independently of others.  Functions are provided for computing the graphic's
bounding box and whether or not it intersects a given point or rectangle.  
.PP
Graphics are persistent in that each defines a representation of itself that
can be automatically written to and read from disk.  The \fBGraphic\fP class
is derived from \fBPersistent\fP, described in Persistent(3I), which
provides this functionality in a general persistent object class.  Graphics
use persistent paint objects that are analogous to the paint objects used by
painters.  Persistent paint objects are defined in
<InterViews/Graphic/ppaint.h>.
.PP
Graphic(3I) contains all you need to know to use \fBGraphic\fP and derived
classes without the persistence feature.  If persistent graphics are
required, then you should read Persistent(3I).
.PP
The \fIlibgraphic\fP provides two additional classes for use with structured
graphics objects.  \fBDamage\fP supports incremental redraw of graphical
objects whose appearance has been modified.  \fBGraphicBlock\fP is an
interactor that displays a structured graphics object.  A GraphicBlock
interprets a perspective to allow scrolling and zooming of the graphic it
contains.
