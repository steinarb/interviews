The InterViews 3.1 distribution contains a README file and a single
subdirectory, \252{\size{10}iv}\272, that contains the source and
documentation.  InterViews can be compiled with any C++ compiler that
accepts the 2.0, 2.1, or 3.0 revisions of the language, and can run
on X11R4 or X11R5.  You can specify your compiler and other site definitions
in the file \252iv/src/config/InterViews/local.de{\font{Helvetica}\size{10}f}\272.

\quad The README{\font{Helvetica} }file describes how to build InterViews.  Under
\252iv/src\272, the directory \252include{\font{Helvetica}\size{10}\272
}contains include directories, \252bin\272 contains applications (each
in its own subdirectory), \252lib\272 contains libraries (each in
its own subdirectory), \252config\272 contains configuration-specific
files, \252man\272 contains PostScript or troff for the manual, and
\252papers\272 contains PostScript for user tutorials.

\quad \quad The work at Stanford has been supported by Fujitsu America,
Digital Equipment Corporation, and NASA CASIS project under Contract
NAGW 419, and a grant from the Charles Lee Powell Foundation.  Special
thanks to Ira Machefsky of Digital and Charles Brauer of Fujitsu America
for their assistance.  We are also grateful to the ever-growing InterViews
user community for its encouragement and support.

\preamble{{\align{center}Differences between 3.0 and 3.1}}%
%
InterViews 3.1 contains several improvements over 3.0.1.  WidgetKit
is an improved implementation of the Kit class that was in 3.0.1.  DialogKit
is a class that provides a file chooser dialog using WidgetKit compoments.  LayoutKit
is a class that provides convenient operations for creating layout
objects such as boxes and glue, replacing the many independent classes
such as LRBox and VGlue in 3.0.1.  Chapter 9 of the reference manual
describes WidgetKit, Chapter 10 describes DialogKit, and Chapter 11
describes LayoutKit.

\quad Glyph and other subclasses of Resource are no longer derived
as virtual base classes.  This change was made primarily for efficiency
and convenience because many C++ compilers do not generate particularly
efficient code for virtual base classes (especially in space), and
some compilers have bugs in this area.

\quad The Glyph protocol has been extended with an {\font{Times-Italic}undraw}
operation that notifies a glyph that it no longer has an allocation
on the canvas.  This operation is primarily for objects that cache
information or perform computation when they are visible.

\quad A new monoglyph subclass, called InputHandler, replaces the
old Listener class.  InputHandler is much simpler to use than the
previous combination of Listener and PointerHandler, as well as providing
limited support for focus management.

\quad The Window class now has a style object as one of its attributes.  The
style can be set to defined attributes such as name and geometry,
as well as a \252visual\272 type for the window.  On systems that
support overlay planes, the attribute \252overlay\272 can be used
to  request  the window be allocated in the window planes.

\quad InterViews 3.1 also includes a new faster implementation of
the Style class and a copy of the latest version of Sam Leffler's
TIFF library (v3.0) for reading images.  The old 2.6 structured graphics
library is no longer included, though it probably would still work
with this distribution.

\quad The documentation has been reorganized to reflect some of the
3.1 changes, as well as provide a structure for future releases.  In
addition to the reference manual, a new collection of example programs
is provided under iv/src/examples.
