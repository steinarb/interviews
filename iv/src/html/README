Instructions for auto-generating ivtools html documentation.
------------------------------------------------------------

1. Background

ivtools header files (.h files) include comments that can be extracted
by PERCEPS, an automatic documentation generator for C++ written in
Perl (http://starship.python.net/crew/tbryan/PERCEPS/).

ivtools uses three techniques supported by PERCEPS for embedding
extractable comments:

	1. one-line class definition -- comments that proceed a class
	definition (or any free-standing function, global, or typedef)
	that start with a "//:"

	2. multi-line class description -- comments that follow a
	"//:" comment that start with "//", and still proceed the
	class definition.

	3. class member descriptions -- comments inside a class
	definition that begin with a "//" that immediately follow any
	particular item.

Normal C comments, of the "/* */" style are not extracted.

PERCEPS first extracts the class information, then uses a directory of
templates (PERL plugins) to generate documentation of arbitrary
format.  The "templates" directory within this directory generates
HTML documentation for each individual class, plus two global indexes,
and one page of miscellaneous information.


2. Generating HTML Documentation for C++ Classes

To generate the HTML documentation for each C++ class defined in
ivtools, do the following:

	2.1 Acquire and install a copy of PERCEPS, Version 3.4.1 or
	greater.  Get it from the maintainers's website:

		http://starship.python.net/crew/tbryan/PERCEPS/

	or from here:

		http://www.vectaport.com/pub/src/perceps341.tgz

	2.2 Verify your version of Perl is >= 5.003 with:

		perl --version

	
	2.3 Verify your copy of Perl is installed at /bin/perl:

		which perl

	    If it is not at that location, edit the first line of the 
	    perceps script in this directory to reflect the actual
	location, or make a symbol link for.


	2.4 Run the following commands to generate the html:

		mkdir classes
		cd ..
		perceps -d `pwd`/html/classes -o `pwd`/html/templates `cat ../MANIFEST.perceps`
	        cd html

	    The whole process takes some time, especially the generation of the
	    global html/classes/index.html.	


3. Generating Derived Class HTML

Two more web pages are needed in the classes sub-directory to make it
complete: derivedclasses.html, a list of links to class web pages
immediately followed by links to each of their immediate derived (or
children) classes; and derivedtree.html, a tree structured web page of
all classes without parents followed by their complete tree of derived
classes.

iclass has been modified to generate these automatically.

	3.1 Generating classes/derivedclasses.html

	cd ..;iclass -r -c -d . >html/classes/derivedclasses.html;cd html

	3.2 Generating classes/derivedtree.html

	cd ..;iclass -r -c -t . >html/classes/derivedtree.html;cd html

4. Acquiring HTML Documentation related to InterViews 3.1

Some of the HTML documentation generated for the ivtools classes
contains embedded links to HTML versions of the original InterViews
3.1 man pages and reference manual.  Two scripts are included in this
directory to facilitate downloading these directories from the online
directory of ivtools documentation.  These web pages are available
under the same COPYRIGHT and license of ivtools.

	4.1 HTML versions of InterViews 3.1 man pages

	Run the shell script getman31.sh from this directory.
	Requires an installed and working copy of the ivtools utility
	ivdl.  The script can be edited to use w3c or curl or any other
	command line URL grabber.

	4.2 HTML versions of InterViews 3.1 reference manual

	Run the shell script getrefman31.sh from this directory.
	Requires an installed and working copy of the ivtools utility
	ivdl.  The script can be edited to use w3c or curl or any other
	command line URL grabber.
