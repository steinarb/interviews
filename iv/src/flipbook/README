NAME
     flipbook - multi-frame editor and viewer derived from drawtool

SYNOPSIS
     flipbook [-bookgeom] ['X-params'] [file]

DESCRIPTION

flipbook is a program derived from idraw/drawtool that supports
multi-frame graphic display.  The zeroth frame is always visible as
the background frame, and in front of it is displayed the current
frame (1 thru n).

The Frame menu controls the frame display mechanism.  The operations
are:

Menu Item	Keyboard  Description
--------------  --------  -----------
Move Forward    ^F        move forward one frame
Move Backward   ^B        move backward one frame
Goto First Frame          move to the first frame
Goto Last Frame           move to the last frame
New Forward      F        create new frame in front of the current
                          frame and make it the current frame
New Backward     B        create new frame in back of the current
                          frame and make it the current frame
Copy Forward     X        copy current frame in front of itself
Copy Backward    Y        copy current frame in back of itself
Delete           D        delete current frame (the zeroth frame
                          can never be deleted)

By default a flipbook document is positioned on the first frame
when opened (if one exists).  "Move Backward" can be used to move to
the background frame when positioned on the first frame.  "Move
Forward" then returns to the first frame.  

The New command creates a document with only a background frame.  The
"New After" command can then be used to initialize the first frame
("New Before" does not work when the current frame is the background
frame).

flipbook save/restores its documents with a script language
specific to flipbook (and possibly programs derived from
flipbook).  Idraw format drawings can be imported via the "Import
Graphic" command (under the File menu).  "Export Graphic" exports
currently selected graphics in the idraw format.  The Print command
(under the File menu) generates a multi-page Postscript document, one
page per frame except for the zeroth frame.
