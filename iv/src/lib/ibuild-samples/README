The subdirectories contain demo applications that are generated by
ibuild.  After successful building of your interviews tree, you should

1)  Make copies of the directories of interest

2)  Fire up ibuild and read in the user interface definition file
    associated with each subdirectory.  For instance, in the "Clock"
    subdirectory, you should read "Clock/clock" into ibuild.

3)  Execute

    "Generate Code..." or type "P" 

    in ibuild to generate and build the application.  

Most subdirectories have two additional subclass files and a
prototypical main file that contain user code to control the
interfaces (make sure you don't overwrite these files by leaving the
corresponding checkboxes blank when ibuild generate code).
Makefiles generated by ibuild would automatically generate
dependencies for them.

You also can change the appearance of the interface in ibuild and
regenerate code so as to see the effects on the appearance of the 
generated interface.

Note the following:

1)  "VWork/vwork.exe" and "VMouse/vmouse.exe" have to be run together.
    In particular, you should choose a host to run "VWork/vwork.exe" first
    and then run "VMouse/vmouse.exe [hostname]" where hostname is the 
    machine name where "VWork/vwork.exe" is running.  Multiple "vmouse.exe"
    can coexist simultaneously.  A dedicated port id 1040 is used.  A
    more appropriate id can be selected by redefining port_id under
    "VWork/VWork.c" and "VMouse/VMouse.c".

    Note: These two applications implement ipc using the RPC classes,
    so you should make sure that parameter BuildRPCClasses is defined
    as YES in "iv/src/config/InterViews/params.def".
