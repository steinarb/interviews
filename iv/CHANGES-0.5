December 17th 1997  ivtools-0.5.10

Drawing Editor Changes
	
	* changed idraw to snap-to-grid when importing with gravity on,
 	and drawtool to snap-to-grid when importing with centering and
 	gravity on.

	* changed iclass to work better with ACE header files.

	* fixed bug in relative pathnames (of a raster or stencil) when
 	document is saved to an alternate directory by forcing them to
 	absolute pathnames.  

	* tested and fixed comdraw's reading commands from stdin.  Now it
 	works for redirected stdin as well.

Interpreter Changes
	
	* added an exit() command to comterp and comdraw.
	
	* added default values to ComFunc::stack_arg (to return when
 	argument not found) and ComFunc::stack_key (to return when keyword
 	is found with no argument).
	
Library Changes

	* added support for arbitrary numeric types to GrayRaster
	(char, unsigned char, short, unsigned short, int, unsigned int,
 	long, unsigned long, float, double).

	* expanded OverlayRaster's support for the GrayRaster API by
 	adding dummy methods as required.

	* changed Painter::x_or back to Painter::xor to get Target Jr
 	3.0beta compiling on top of ivtools.

	* evolved the fixed size graphics mechanism to have a scaleability
 	factor.  Hardwired to power of 2 zoom at present.

	* created static void GAcknowledgeDialog::post(Window*,const char*)
  	(useful for posting simple acknowledge dialog boxes)
	
	* added a static AttributeValue::type_size(ValueType) method as
 	well as member AttributeValue::type_size() method

	* added static and member AttributeValue::is_char, is_short,
 	is_int, is_long, is_float, and is_double methods (treats unsigned
 	same as signed)

	* added an OverlayViewer::SetMagnification which calls
 	AdjustForZoom.

Configuration Changes
	
	* adopted include-file install targets and extra __linux__
 	#ifdef'ed code (IV-X11/xwindow.c, Dispatch/netinet_in.h,
 	Dispatch/rpcregistery.c) from Guenter Geiger's ivtools_0.5-1.diffs
	(the Debian 2.0 package diff file).
	
	* rearranged the build order in src/Imakefile to contruct binaries as
 	soon as required libraries exist.

	* removed specification of GccIncludeDir from config/gcc.def,
 	because this is no longer needed now that we do makedepend with
 	gcc.
	

October 31st 1997  ivtools-0.5.9

	* adds ACE import to flipbook multi-frame editor.

	* new flipbook frame creation commands: "copy forward"
 	and "copy backward" (CopyMoveFrameCmd).

	* new flipbook frame viewing commands: "show previous frame" and
 	"hide previous frame" (ShowOtherFrameCmd).

	* changes the MoveFrameCmd's to use the deferring Unidraw::Update
 	instead of the immediate FrameEditor::Update, so that MacroCmd's
 	that contain a MoveFrameCmd do all the work before the a) cursor
 	is reset, and b) the viewer is moved to the new frame.

	* fixes problem with symbolic links generated by "make install" when
	InstallRelative is enabled.

	* adds dialog boxes to inform the user when an import fails or the
	colormap allocation fails.

	* add OverlaySelectTool that ignores single-clicks on graphic
 	views that match a list of types.  Useful when selecting graphics
 	in front of rasters and stencils.  Not used by default.

	* make text graphics painted at 1x ignore a stipple pattern in
	the graphic context just like they do at 2x and .5x.

October 1st 1997  ivtools-0.5.8

	* add "telcat" mode to comterp test program, allowing for the
 	remote cat'ing of files to drawtool, etc., i.e. "comterp telcat
 	localhost 20001 test.ppm" would connect to a drawtool with import
 	service at port 20001 and transmit a PPM image file.

	* add these methods to OverlayViewer to simplify translation
 	between coordinate systems: ScreenToDrawing, DrawingToScreen.

	* rename OvGrayImage to GrayRaster, and set up a static
 	RasterOvComp::UseGrayRaster() to enable/disable its use
 	(GrayRaster is an OverlayRaster with in-memory copy of original
 	pixel values).

	* generalize PBM/PGM/PPM header reading to allow for line-feeds
	between ncols and nrows.

	* modify MoveFrameCmd to optionally disallow moving to the
 	background frame.

	* remove an unnecessary call to FrameEditor::UpdateFrame from
 	within FrameEditor::Update (that should only be done when the
 	current frame changes, not just when anything changes within the
 	current frame).

	* modify TopoFace::npts() to only count the points in the first
 	face (ignoring islands).  This fixes a bug in ivmaps dlgviewer.

	* remove static linking conflict of StringList object (one has
 	been renamed CopyStringList).

	* add a slightly modified ivmkmf to the script directory

	* modify iclass to work on the vtk-2.0 source tree

September 15th 1997  ivtools-0.5.7

	* various bugs were isolated and removed from the command
 	interpreter server mechanism embedded in ivtools, notably infinite
 	loops caused by premature disconnects of remote clients.
	
	* floating point geometric objects were expanded to be able to 
 	render themselves to a bitmap without the use of an X
 	server.

	* other attempts were made to isolate any X server dependencies in
 	the server framework -- currently one remains, a need to store the
 	patterns of a graphic state on the X server -- to be removed by
 	the 0.6 release.

July 24th 1997  ivtools-0.5.6

	* the import service mechanism was further expanded in ivtools, so
 	any remote program can ship drawings or images to a viewer by
 	establishing a connection over the network.

	* commands to desensitize graphics in a viewer were added to
 	ivtools (to complement existing commands for hiding graphics in a
 	viewer, fixing the size or location of graphics in a viewer).
  	Although a long standing capability of the software, this was the
 	first time it was exposed to the user with a sample command.

	* the save/restore spatial object transcription mechanism of
 	ivtools was expanded to include support for inline bitmaps. It was
 	also reorganized to be more object-oriented.

	* an initial attempt was made to blend in the graph-node editing
 	mechanisms of the GraphUnidraw class library with the command
 	interpreter mechanisms of the ComUnidraw class library.

July 1st 1997  ivtools-0.5.5

	* ivtools was expanded to include support for importing by piping
 	from a command line filter, useful for displaying the results of
 	various idraw compatible renderers (see
 	http://www.vectaport.com/ivtools/idraw.html for examples).
