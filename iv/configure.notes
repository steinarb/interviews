The configure script is generated from configure.in using autoconf, then
manually modified in three ways:

	1) the --with-x command line option is removed.
	2) the --help output for everything from --exec-prefix to
	   --target is removed, because no use is made of these.
	3) the body of the AC_CXX_HEADERS macro is manually inserted,
	   copied from another configure script that must have had this
	   macro defined in its autoconf environment.
