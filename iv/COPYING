From Sept. 6th 2000 to May 18th 2001 I represented that ivtools was
dual-licensed under its original BSD-like license and the GPL.  On May
18th 2001 I became aware of the complete requirements for
dual-licensing against GPL, and decided to discontinue dual licensing
for the time being.  ivtools is still free software, as defined by the
Free Software Foundation, it's just not dual-licensed with the GPL.  I
would still be amenable to the creation of a dual distribution (with
provisions for possible GPL-only enhancements) if requested by other
collaborators.
