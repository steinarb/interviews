The InterViews GUI toolkit.

This repository tries to preserve the available history of the
InterViews GUI toolkit from Stanford, and later SGI.

Copyright of this code resides in iv/COPYRIGHT

My reason for doing this, is to be able to browse the history of
InterViews.

InterViews was (and I still think is) a very good GUI toolkit.

I've imported the tar balls of first the original InterViews 2.6,
3.0.1, 3.1, and 3.2a releases.

InterViews had two descendants:
 - Fresco (which I was unable to google my way to any releases of)
 - ivtools http://www.ivtools.org/ivtools/

Then I've imported the ivtools tar balls I could find into a branch
named ivtools.

Finally I merged the ivtools branch into master, replacing the
original InterViews contents.

The ivtools code has many improvements to the graphical editor code of
InterViews.  The ivtools code also replaces IMake with GNU configure.
